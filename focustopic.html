    <h1 id="title">Our Focus Problem in ICT</h1>
    <p id="problem-text">Our focus problem is the lack of confidence with ICT in education, <br>
        which affects both students and teachers. Many students and teachers don’t <br>
        feel comfortable using technology, which can make learning and teaching more <br>
        challenging.

    <h2>How it Affects Us</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Students may struggle with digital tasks, online activities, or following lessons.</li>

<li>Teachers spend extra time helping students individually, which slows down lessons.</li>

<li>Unequal participation can occur, where some students take the lead while others fall behind.</li>

<li>Overall, the learning experience becomes less effective, and ICT-based education cannot reach its full potential.</li>
